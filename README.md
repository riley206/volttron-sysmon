# volttron-sysmon

The System Monitoring Agent (colloquially “SysMon”) can be installed on the platform to monitor system resource metrics,
including but not limited to percent CPU utilization, percent system memory (RAM) utilization, and percent storage (disk) utilization based
on disk path.

## Requires

* python >= 3.10
* volttron >= 10.0

## Installation

Before installing, VOLTTRON should be installed and running.  Its virtual environment should be active.
Information on how to install of the VOLTTRON platform can be found
[here](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core).

Create a directory called `config` and use the change directory command to enter it.

```shell
mkdir config
cd config
```

After entering the config directory, create a file named `sysmon_agent_config.json`, use the below JSON to populate your new file.

For simplicity, copy all of the JSON from [here](sysmon_agent_config.json) and switch the key `"poll": false,` to `"poll": true,` for each system resource you want to monitor.

Besides `poll`, there are four other important options in sysmons configuration.

- `default_publish_type` only needs to be specified once in the configuration, this is the default publish type.
- `base_topic` also only needs to be specified once. This is the base topic.
- `point_name` changes the point name for the specific system monitor. In combination with publish_type and base_topic our data for cpu_precent would be published to volttron with a topic of: **datalogger/Log/Platform/CPU/Percent** using the below json as an example.
- `check_interval` adjusts the time in seconds to poll for new system data. This can be modified for each system resource.

The Sysmon agent serves as a wrapper for psutil. You can adjust resource specific options by adjusting false to true in the configuration file. For detailed insights into these options and their impact, you can read the [psutil documentation](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You may also delete any unused fields if desired. For example, a configuration to monitor just cpu_precent could look like this.

```json
{
    "default_publish_type": "datalogger",
    "base_topic": "Log/Platform",
    "monitor": {
        "cpu_percent": {
            "point_name": "CPU/Percent",
            "check_interval": 5,
            "poll": false,
            "params": {
                "per_cpu": true,
                "capture_interval": null
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Install and start the sysmon agent

```bash
vctl install volttron-sysmon --vip-identity agent.sysmon --start
```

Add `sysmon_agent_config.json` to the configuration store

```bash
vctl config store agent.sysmon config sysmon_agent_config.json
```

Observe Data

To see data being published to the bus, install a [Listener Agent](https://pypi.org/project/volttron-listener/):

```bash
vctl install volttron-listener --start
```

### Periodic Publish

At the interval specified by the configuration option for each resource, the agent will automatically query the system
for the resource utilization statistics and publish it to the message bus using the topic as previously described.  The
message content for each publish will contain only a single numeric value for that specific topic.  Currently,
“scrape_all” style publishes are not supported.

The following is an example of the LoadAverage publish captured by the Listener agent in the VOLTTRON log:

```log
